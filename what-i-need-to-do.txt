Create an embedded Shopify dev app using the official Remix template, built with TypeScript and React. Use Prisma and PostgreSQL for the database. 

Build an admin interface with Polaris that allows user to: 
Select one or more products using app bridge resource picker. 
Fill in a custom field. 
After saving, the app backend should create a metafield in the selected products using GraphQL, storing the userâ€™s input in the custom field. 

Add a theme app extension that injects a Liquid snippet on the product page to display the metafield value.
